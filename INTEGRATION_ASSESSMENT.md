# Initialize
db = EnhancedSemanticSubstrateDatabase("mydata.db")

# Store with awareness
db.store_concept_with_awareness("divine wisdom", "biblical")

# Process thoughts
result = db.process_thought_to_concept(
    "How can I grow spiritually?",
    ThoughtType.SPIRITUAL_GUIDANCE,
    ContextDomain.PERSONAL
)

# Enable self-enhancing relationships
db.enable_self_enhancing_relationships(context="biblical")

# Query with thoughts
results = db.query_with_thought_understanding(
    "I need guidance",
    "biblical"
