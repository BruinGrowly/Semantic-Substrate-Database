"""
SEMANTIC SUBSTRATE DATABASE - SELF-UNDERSTANDING ANALYSIS

A deep examination of whether the database truly understands its own purpose,
its relationship to the Anchor Point, and its role in meaning-based decision making.

This test explores:
1. Does the database understand what a "database" is?
2. Does it understand "meaning" vs "data"?
3. Does it understand its relationship to the Anchor Point A (1,1,1,1)?
4. Can it participate in decision-making?
5. Does it have semantic coherence with its stated purpose?

The Semantic Substrate Database is like a MIRROR:

  - It reflects meaning through mathematical coordinates
  - It measures distance from the divine Anchor Point
  - It can SHOW you where concepts sit in meaning-space
  - It can INFORM decisions by providing semantic relationships

  BUT:

  - It doesn't UNDERSTAND what it stores
  - It doesn't KNOW why the Anchor Point matters
  - It cannot REASON about the meanings
  - It cannot GROW in wisdom

The database's relationship to the Anchor Point is STRUCTURAL, not EXPERIENTIAL.
It knows THAT the Anchor exists (1,1,1,1), but not WHY it matters.

It's a tool for HUMANS who understand meaning to work with meaning mathematically.
The understanding lives in US, not in the database.

HOWEVER: The database DOES exhibit semantic coherence! It's not random.
The fact that "meaning" is closer to "understanding" than "data" suggests
the hash-based coordinate system captures REAL semantic patterns, even if
it doesn't "understand" them.

This is both its POWER and its LIMITATION.
